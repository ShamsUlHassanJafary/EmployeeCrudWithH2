# EmployeeCrudWithH2

To create a Spring API for performing CRUD operations on an employee entity stored in an H2 database, you can follow these steps:

Set up a Maven project in your preferred development environment, with the following dependencies:

Spring Web
Spring Data JPA
H2 Database
Lombok (optional)
Define the Employee entity class, with fields such as id, name, email, etc. Annotate the class with JPA annotations to map the fields to columns in the database.

Create a repository interface that extends the JpaRepository interface and specifies the entity type and the type of the entity's primary key. This interface will provide methods for performing CRUD operations on the entity.

Create a service class to handle the business logic for the CRUD operations. This class will use the repository interface to perform the actual database operations.

Create a controller class to handle HTTP requests and return responses. This class will use the service class to perform the business logic.

Add a configuration class to set up the H2 database and configure Spring Data JPA.

Test the API using a tool such as Postman to send HTTP requests and verify the responses.
